# stars
### you're so vain / you probably think these stars are about yout

## why

[Favstar](http://favstar.fm) is about opening another line of dialogue between you and your Twitter followers. Namely, the one where someone likes what you tweet but is too nervous to tell you to your face, so instead you shake them down in the kitchen after a long tequila bender where all you want is to steal their precious stars and keep them for yourself.

So anyway, I spend a lot of time on the command line, and switching over to the browser just to view [my stars](http://favstar.fm/users/holman/recent) is so pass√©.

## how

`gem install stars`

`stars`
