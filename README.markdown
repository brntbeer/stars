# stars
### you're so vain / you probably think these stars are about you

## why

[Favstar](http://favstar.fm) is about opening another line of dialogue between you and your Twitter followers. Like the one where someone likes what you tweet but is too nervous to tell you to your face and they star your tweets instead, so instead you shake them down in the kitchen after a long tequila bender and steal their precious stars and keep them for yourself.

So anyway, I spend a lot of time on the command line, and switching over to the browser just to view [my stars](http://favstar.fm/users/holman) is so passé.

## how

Install with `gem install stars`, then do a quick `stars`, fill in your Twitter username, and let it do its sultry magic. This is me lately:

You can tell from the relative dearth of stars that I'm in my *screw followers I'm important so here's what I had for lunch* phase. Don't worry; I'll become a star whore again and tweet pop culture references in relation to presidential penile size soon enough.

## state of affairs

This was a one-night hack thing; ideally it'd be cool to allow some username switching, maybe retain some "this was read" state, and improve the formatting (if only "★" worked better in a fixed-width environment, AMIRITE?). All in due time. I mean, for you to fork and do it yourself, I mean.

## who

[@holman](http://twitter.com/holman) did this. Follow me and star my stuff incessantly so we can prove to Dean Allen that stars are as important as currency, much [to his logically-argued dismay](http://favrd.textism.com/).
